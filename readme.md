## Machine Learning Foundations Repository


This repository provides implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms.  The implementations are written from scratch in both Python and Julia.  The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for undering the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms and to explore inner workings of the algorithms to gain a deeper understanding of these techniques.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
ml_foundations/
├── ml-julia/
│   ├── regression/
│   ├── classification/
│   ├── clustering/
│   ├── ...
├── ml-python/
│   ├── regression/
│   ├── classification/
│   ├── clustering/
│   ├── ...
├── README.md

```

The `ml-julia/` and `ml-python/` directories contain the respective implementations of machine learning algorithms in Julia and Python. Each sub-directory within these folders corresponds to a specific category of algorithms, such as regression, classification, clustering, and more.
